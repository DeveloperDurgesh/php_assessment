Logic Overview:
This PHP script accepts a hierarchical sequence of numbers (like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.1) as input and then restructures it into a corrected format. The structure is represented as a tree, and the corrected sequence is returned as a flat list, where each sequence follows a consistent numbering system based on its hierarchy.

The input is submitted through a form, processed by PHP, and the result is returned as a JSON response, which is then used by JavaScript to display the data in a chart.

Functions:
1. restructure_sequence($input)
Purpose: This function takes the input sequence (array of hierarchical values) and builds a tree structure based on the hierarchy represented by dots (e.g., 1.1, 1.2.1).

How It Works:

It splits each sequence item by the dot (.) to determine the different levels (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

It creates a nested structure (tree) to represent this hierarchy.

2. reindex_tree($node, $prefix, &$result)
Purpose: This function recursively re-indexes the tree and flattens it back into a sequence.

How It Works:

It traverses through each level of the tree and assigns a new index to each sequence based on its depth in the hierarchy.

It builds a corrected sequence by re-indexing the nodes (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1).

Example Flow:
The user enters a sequence (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.1) and submits it.

The input sequence is processed by the restructure_sequence() function, which builds a hierarchy tree.

The reindex_tree() function re-indexes the tree and converts it back into a corrected flat sequence (e.g., 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1).

The corrected sequence is returned as a JSON response, which JavaScript uses to update the chart on the webpage.
